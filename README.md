# Hangman Game Description

Hangman is a classic word game played by two people, the prompter and guesser. 
while keeping track of how many times a guesser has an incorrect guess, the prompter asks the guesser to guess a word.
The guesser guesses a word at a time and has a fixed number of guesses given to him/her. If he/she guesses all of them, he wins otherwise, he loses.
